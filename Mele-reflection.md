**Mitch's relfection answers**


*What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
  -I was having issues with knowing when to fork or when to create a local repo in addition to remembering to always workon a feature branch!

*What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
  The push/pull process. I feel much more confident in doing this now after the gps.

*What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
  I had questions about the inline screen shot on markdown and when to merge or fetch (found out that its the same as pull).

*What still confuses you about Git?
  When to create locally and when to clone. I have learned that in most cases we will clone in DBC.

*How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
  I had a great expierence. The guide did a great job of letting us research the answer and offering support while not giving us any answers. She also gave a lot of tips. Very helpful!
