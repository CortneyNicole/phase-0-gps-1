# GPS1 Reflection

* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
  **I was having issue switching between branches.**
* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
  **Switching between branches was definatly clarified. Also it was nice to go over the git work flow with a peer and have guide there to verify that it was being done correctly.**
* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
  **I honestly feel like the whole thing was asking questions and bouncying answers off eachother. It was a really nice learning atmosphere. I guess some specifics in the beginning was asking everyone how they were doing. I asked Mich what is experience with code was and if he had ever pair programmed before. As for Brittany(our guide) there was a lot of asking verification question after we did the research make sure we found the right answer.**
* What still confuses you about Git?
  **We ran into a little bit of an issue with the merge conflict. We figured it out but Im still a little confused about it.**
* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
  ** My first experience was really good. We ran into a problem with GitHub going down and had to reschedule but other than that it was amazing. Brittany was a very helpful and knowledgable guide and Mith was a delight to pair with. I feel like we all work really well together.**
